Dataset supporting the paper "Herbivory mediates the response of below-ground food-webs to invasive grasses", published in the Journal of Animal Ecology.

The dataset refers to samples collected across 6 farms in the Bega Valley region of Australia. The farms are located in the grassy woodland ecoregion and are extensively managed with sheep and cattle grazing. Livestock shares the landscape with native mammalian and invertebrate herbivores. On each farm, two nested fenced exclosure systems were established. These included an open area, a fence excluding livestock but allowing access to native mammals and invertebrates, a fence excluding all mammals but allowing access to invertebrates and a shielded cage excluding all invertebrate herbivores as well. In each farm, one of these systems was located in a zone dominated by the native Kangaroo grass, and another in a zone co-dominated by the Invasive African lovegrass. The sample and treatment numbering is provided in the file Sample_metadata.

Soil samples were taken and DNA was extracted and amplified for 16s and ITS markers. The resulting metabarcoding derived ASV tables are presented (16s_ASV_table and ITS_ASV_table), as are the inferred functional profiles for bacteria at the enzyme and pathway level (16s_picrust_enzymes and 16s_picrust_pathways), as derived by the PICRUSt2 pipeline, and the fungal guilds reconstructed with FunGuildR (FunguildR_output).
Chemical, physical and enzymatic assays were also performed on the soil samples (Chemical_data).
Nematodes were extracted from soil cores with a Baermann funnel, counted (Nematodes_counts) and had their DNA extracted and amplified (Nematodes_asv_table). Soil invertebrates were sampled with below-ground pitfall traps and identified to family level (Invertebrates) and earthworms were manually extracted from 202020 cm monoliths ((Earthworm_counts).
Two 20 by 100 cm strips had their vegetation removed and their living and litter biomass quantified by dry weight (Biomass_summary). Sensors measuring moisture and temperature 10 cm beneath the soil surface were installed in each plot and their output is presented in Microclimate_summary.
